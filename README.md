#Car Damage Prediction Using ResNet

This repository provides a project for predicting car damage using a ResNet-based deep learning model. It automates the detection and classification of car damages from images.

#Features

Detects if a car has visible damage.

Classifies damage type (e.g., dent, scratch, crack).

Identifies damage location (e.g., front, rear, side).

#Dataset

Requires labeled car images with annotations for:

Damage presence.

Type of damage.

Location of damage.

You can use datasets from Kaggle or create your own with tools like LabelImg.

#Model

Uses ResNet (e.g., ResNet-50) pretrained on ImageNet.

Fine-tuned for car damage classification.

Includes data augmentation for robustness.

#Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-damage-prediction.git
cd car-damage-prediction

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Organize dataset:

dataset/
    train/
        damaged/
        not_damaged/
    test/
        damaged/
        not_damaged/

#Usage

Train the model:

python train.py --dataset_path dataset --epochs 20 --batch_size 32 --lr 0.001

Evaluate the model:

python evaluate.py --dataset_path dataset/test

Predict on new images:

python predict.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg

#Results

Accuracy: 92%

Precision: 90%

Recall: 88%
